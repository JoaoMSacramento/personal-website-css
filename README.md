#Personal Website - CSS Project

I created this personal website as my final project for the **Cod√©dex** CSS course. 

The project aimed to demonstrate my proficiency in the following areas:
- Writing CSS styles: I utilized selectors and declarations to apply specific styles to different elements on the website.
- Using common CSS properties: I incorporated properties related to color, size, font, text alignment, and background to enhance the visual appeal of the website.
- Working with the box model: I modified the width, height, border, padding, and margin of elements to control their appearance and layout.
- Laying out elements: I employed various layout techniques to arrange elements on the page according to design specifications and ensure a visually appealing user interface.
